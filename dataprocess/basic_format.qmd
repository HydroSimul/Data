### file format for ASCII data

When it comes to plain text formats, there is no universal standard, and it's highly adaptable to specific needs. The initial step in loading a plain text table is to analyze the structure of the file.

Typically, a text table can store 2D data, comprising columns and rows or a matrix. However, above the data body, there's often metadata that describes the data. Metadata can vary widely between data body.

Dividing rows is usually straightforward and can be achieved by identifying row-end characters. However, dividing columns within each row presents multiple possibilities, such as spaces, tabs, commas, or semicolons. 

In .txt files, any of these separators can be used, but in .csv files, commas or semicolons are commonly employed as separator characters.

- **.txt**: This is the most generic and widely used file extension for plain text files. It doesn't imply any specific format or structure; it's just a simple text file.

- **.csv** (Comma-Separated Values): While CSV files contain data separated by commas, they are still considered ASCII files because they use plain text characters to represent data values. Each line in a CSV file typically represents a record, with values separated by commas.
