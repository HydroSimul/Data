# Structure of Time Series

A time series is often adequately described as a function of four components: trend, seasonality, dependent stochastic component and independent residual component [@HydroTimeSeries_machiwal_2012]. It can be mathematically expressed as [@StatisticWater_shahin_1993]:


$$
x_{\mathrm{t}}=T_{\mathrm{t}}+S_{\mathrm{t}}+\varepsilon_{\mathrm{t}}+\eta_{\mathrm{t}} 
$$


where 

- $T_{\mathrm{t}}$ = trend component, 
- $S_{\mathrm{t}}$ = seasonality, 
- $\varepsilon_{\mathrm{t}}$ = dependent stochastic component, and 
- $\eta_{\mathrm{t}}$ = independent residual component.

The first two components can be treat as systematic pattern, which are deterministic in nature, whereas the stochastic component accounts for the random error.
